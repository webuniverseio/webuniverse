##Lodash traverse
Native browser support allows you to traverse and select DOM using `querySelector`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `parent`, and other api methods. But there are a few cases when it is not flexible/compatible enough. [Lodash traverse](https://github.com/szarouski/lodash.dom-traverse) is a tiny addon which provides a dozen of useful, chainable methods which in combination with native api give you minimalistic, yet ultimate control over your html.
 
 ##Simple permissions
 Nothing crazy, just a [small library](https://github.com/szarouski/simple-permissions) which allows you to add or remove multiple permissions for multiple targets. Crossbrowser and crossplatform with 100% coverage.
