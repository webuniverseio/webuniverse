import seo from "./lighthouse-seo.png";

Recently I ported my blog from Hexo engine to Gatsby and as part of that migration I wanted to ensure that SEO is in the best state it can be. I added [structured data](https://schema.org) markup throughout all my site a while ago and wanted to make sure that after migration is done there are no errors. I took a note that I should verify that and moved on.

Migration process took longer than I expected (1 week) and I couldn't find time to verify that structured data is still accurate. Finally I finished most important part of it and started to add small enhancements here and there. Following best practices I run audit on my site using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and there was a note to verify that structured data is valid.
