After installing postgres on Ubuntu 18 (via WSL) using [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/), I run into multiple issues. This article might help someone who also wants to install postgres on WSL (same problems might be happening on native Ubuntu version). First follow instructions in official documentation, then follow steps below.

Change ownership of place where you'll be saving logs to `postgres` user:
```bash
sudo chown postgres /var/log/postgresql
```
Next create symlinks for postgres configuration, not sure why this is not happening by default, perhaps you should setup your own configs, but in my case I just wanted to get it running because I was just following an online course:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf  /var/lib/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/postgresql/10/main/conf.d  /var/lib/postgresql/10/main/conf.d
```
Finally start server as postgres user:
```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/10/main -l /var/log/postgresql/logfile start
```

After that, in order to start working with Postgres from command line I used following command: 
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql postgres
```

Good luck :)
